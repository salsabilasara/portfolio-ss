One of the highlights of the training was the exposure to the **Quality Check Department**, where I learned about the various tests and inspections conducted to ensure that the transformers meet **industry standards**. This department plays a critical role in ensuring the **reliability** and **safety** of the products before delivery to clients.

Overall, this training provided me with valuable insights into **manufacturing techniques**, **quality control processes**, and the importance of maintaining high standards in **electrical systems production**.
