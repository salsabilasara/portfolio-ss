# Personal Drone Project

**Project Type:** Personal Project  
**Time Period:** During the COVID-19 pandemic

---

## Project Overview
In the first year of my engineering program, I decided to explore my fascination with drones by building one from scratch. The pandemic provided an ideal opportunity to pursue this hands-on project in my free time. Without formal coursework or prior experience, I relied on online resources like Google and YouTube, learning through trial and error.

The goal was straightforward: create a functional drone. What began as a curious experiment turned into a rewarding journey of discovery, teaching me about drone mechanics, electronics, and programming. This project was a perfect outlet for creativity and problem-solving.

## Working Mechanism

### **Data Acquisition**
- Sensors continuously measured altitude and detected nearby obstacles, aiding in flight path adjustments and crash prevention.

### **Stabilized Flight**
- The flight controller utilized gyroscope data to maintain balance during hover and motion.

### **Obstacle Avoidance**
- Obstacle detection sensors redirected the drone when objects were detected, enhancing flight safety.

### **Remote Control**
- The 2.4 GHz remote allowed real-time control of the drone's direction, altitude, and speed.

## Challenges and Solutions
The project presented several challenges:
- **Wiring and Electronics:** Troubleshooting connections took multiple attempts, often guided by online forums and YouTube tutorials.
- **Sensor Calibration:** Ensuring accurate data from the altitude and obstacle detection sensors required extensive trial and error.
- **Flight Stability:** Stabilizing the drone during flight demanded careful tuning of the flight controller and motor settings.

Through persistence and resourcefulness, I overcame these hurdles, learning valuable lessons about patience and adaptability.
