As part of an exciting academic competition, my team and I designed and built a Soccer Bot—a robot capable of playing soccer using a simple Bluetooth control system. The project was both a challenging and rewarding experience, blending creativity, engineering skills, and teamwork. The bot was designed to efficiently navigate the field, approach the ball, and guide it toward the goal without needing complex mechanisms.
